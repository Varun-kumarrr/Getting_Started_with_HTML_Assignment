Ans :-   HTML documents are made up of tags , tag is basically a system  by which the structure and design of HTML document is made or you can say the structure
         and design of HTML document is dependent or made up of tags.
          Tags are of two types
            1. Opening tag 
            2. Closing tag

            Opening tags are made up of angular brackets “<>” and in between the name of the tag is written “<Name of tag>”
            It starts with “<” then name of tag and then “>”.

            Closing tag is same it only consists forward  slash before name “</name>
            Example : - paragraph tag <p> </p>

Tags are of two types 
Paired tags = the tags which has opening tag and closing tag in it is called paired tag
Example = head tag <h1> </h1>.

Singular tag = the tag which has only an opening tag is known as singular tag.
                        These tags don’t have closing tag because they don’t contain any content                in them
	Example : - line break tag <br>
